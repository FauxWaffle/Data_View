# Data_View
Get file statistics via PowerShell and then view through Python.

To begin, run data_pull.ps1 in terminal as ADMIN - as PowerShell will install Python libraries if not present. 
If Python is not installed, please install before continuing.

After installation of Streamlit and Pandas, terminal will prompt for UNC path input. No need to add around path.



The script will pull data statistics on selected UNC path, then check if creation date and last touch date are equal.
All file statistics will be placed in the datafile.csv file within the CSV folder.
